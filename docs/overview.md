# Architecture Overview — Lamp AI Lamp

## 3-Layer Architecture

```
OpenClaw (AI/LLM) → Lamp Server (Go, :5000) → LeLamp Runtime (Python, :5001) → Hardware
```

| Layer | Language | Port | Role |
|-------|----------|------|------|
| OpenClaw | Go | WS | AI brain, LLM, SKILL.md, memory, channels |
| Lamp Server | Go | 5000 | System (network, OTA, MQTT, reset), sensing event routing, local intent |
| LeLamp Runtime | Python | 5001 | Hardware drivers (servo, LED, camera, audio, display), FastAPI |

## Principles

- **Hardware is a plugin** — plug in and it works, unplug and it's skipped
- **System layer runs WITHOUT OpenClaw** — device always responds
- **Code is the source of truth** — docs reflect code
- **LeLamp is the hardware driver** — no AI logic
- **SKILL.md native** — no MCP, LLM reads skills and calls curl directly

## Voice Pipeline

```
Mic (always on) → Local VAD (RMS energy, free)
    → Speech detected → Connect Deepgram STT
        → "hey lamp, turn off light" → voice_command → local intent → execute
        → "hey wanna grab lunch?" → voice (ambient) → OpenClaw
    → Silence 3s → Disconnect Deepgram
```

## Sensing Flow

```
LeLamp sensing loop (every 2s) → Read 1 camera frame, run all detectors:
    ├─ Motion detection (frame diff) → event if >8% pixels changed
    ├─ Face recognition (InsightFace buffalo_sc) → friend/stranger classification
    │     → presence.enter (annotated JPEG with colored bboxes: green=friend, red=stranger)
    │     → presence.leave (3 consecutive ticks without face)
    ├─ Light level (mean brightness, every 30s) → event if change >30/255
    └─ Sound detection (mic RMS) → event if > threshold

Event has image? (large motion, face enter) → encode frame full-resolution JPEG q85
Face enter image: original frame annotated with bounding boxes + labels

POST /api/sensing/event {type, message, image?}
    → Lamp Go:
        1. Voice event + local intent match? → execute directly (~50ms)
        2. No match → forward to OpenClaw:
           - Has image → SendChatMessageWithImage (text + vision content block)
           - No image → SendChatMessage (text only)
        3. OpenClaw AI sees image + reads context → decides action → calls SKILL API
```

Cooldowns to protect LLM costs: motion/sound 60s, presence 10s, light.level 30s.
