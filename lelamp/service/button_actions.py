"""Shared button/touch actions.

Reused by any input device that maps to the same three gestures:
- single_click_action(): stop speaker / unmute mic + announce listening
- triple_click_action(): reboot OS
- long_press_action():  shutdown OS

Callers (GPIO button, touchpad, future remotes) only need to detect the
gesture and invoke the matching function — the destructive sequencing
(TTS announce → servo park → shutdown/reboot) lives here so every input
path gets the same safe behavior.
