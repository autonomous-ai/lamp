# AI Lamp — Product Vision

> The world's first lamp that truly knows you.

---

## 1. Vision & Mission

**Vision**: Create the most intelligent, expressive, and useful desk lamp ever made — a lamp that is not merely controlled, but genuinely understood by the person who uses it.

**Mission**: Combine best-in-class desk lighting with a deeply personal AI companion and an open-source platform, so that a single object on your desk replaces an app-controlled light, a smart speaker, a desk robot, and a mood indicator — and does each of those jobs better than any dedicated product.

**One-sentence pitch**: AI Lamp is the best desk lamp in the world, the most expressive companion robot, the smartest AI assistant (powered by OpenClaw), and an open-source platform — no other product combines all four.

---

## 2. The Four Pillars — What Makes AI Lamp 10x Better

Every competitor delivers one of these partially. AI Lamp delivers all four completely.

### Pillar 1: "It Understands Me" — Deep Personal AI

Most smart lamps respond to commands. AI Lamp responds to *you*.

| Situation | What AI Lamp Does |
|---|---|
| You sound stressed (voice tone analysis) | Auto-dims, plays soft ambient sound, lamp leans closer |
| You are deep in focus (sustained quiet typing) | Stays silent, holds focus lighting, suppresses notifications |
| You just walked in after work | Happy greeting, warm light, asks about your day |
| You are staying up past midnight | Gentle reminder, reduces blue light gradually |
| A week later | "Last week you said you had a deadline — how did it go?" |

**Why no competitor can match this**: OpenClaw's long-term memory persists across days, weeks, and months. Multi-provider LLM support (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, local models) means the AI layer is never locked to a single vendor's capability ceiling. The lamp literally gets to know you over time.

### Pillar 2: "It Feels Alive" — Generative Body Language

Competing products replay preset animations. AI Lamp generates unique physical expressions in real time.

| Emotion | Servo (5-axis) | LED (64 RGB pixels) | Audio |
|---|---|---|---|
| Curious | Tilt head toward user | Soft warm yellow | Quiet inquisitive hum |
| Thinking | Gentle rhythmic sway | Slow purple pulse | — |
| Surprised | Quick upward rise | Bright white flash | Short chime |
| Sad | Slow droop downward | Dim cool blue | — |
| Excited | Energetic bounce | Fast rainbow ripple | Happy chirp |
| Listening | Slight lean forward | Steady soft white ring | — |

The LLM decides the combination of servo position, LED pattern, and audio for each reaction. Because the parameters are continuous (angle, color, timing, intensity), no two expressions are identical. The lamp never feels robotic.

### Pillar 3: "It's Actually Useful" — Not Just Cute

Expressiveness without utility is a toy. AI Lamp is a serious productivity and wellness tool.

- **Best desk lamp**: Circadian lighting that adjusts color temperature throughout the day. Video call optimization that analyzes your face lighting and repositions the lamp head. Focus mode that locks brightness and suppresses interruptions.
- **Real assistant**: Calendar awareness, email summaries, reminders, news briefs, timer/Pomodoro — all via natural voice.
- **Extensible skills**: Community-created SKILL.md files add new capabilities without firmware updates. Personalities, animations, integrations — all pluggable.
- **Multi-channel presence**: Chat with your lamp via Telegram, Slack, or Discord when you are away from your desk. It is still "there."
- **Open source platform**: Fork it, extend it, build products on it.

### Pillar 4: "It Acts on Its Own" — Autonomous Sensing & Proactive Behavior

Most smart devices are reactive — they wait for commands. Lamp is **proactive** — it continuously senses its environment and acts autonomously without being asked.

This is the difference between a tool and a companion. A tool waits. A companion pays attention.

**Lamp = senses (cheap, always-on).** **OpenClaw = brain (smart, called when needed).**

#### Autonomous Behaviors

| Trigger | What Lamp Senses | What Lamp Does | Who Decides |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Arrive** | Camera: person enters frame | Turn on, warm greeting, adjust light to preference | OpenClaw (personality) |
| **Leave** | Camera: no presence for 15 min | Dim → sleep → off | Lamp (rule-based, configurable) |
| **Darkness** | Camera: ambient light drops | Gradually increase brightness | Lamp (auto) + OpenClaw (scene choice) |
| **Focus** | Mic: sustained silence + typing sounds | Hold steady, suppress interruptions | Lamp (detect) → OpenClaw (confirm) |
| **Stress** | Mic: sighs, tense voice tone | Shift to warm light, offer break | OpenClaw (empathy, memory) |
| **Joy** | Mic: laughter | Lamp bounces, warm flash, join the mood | OpenClaw (emotion skill) |
| **Late night** | Time: past user's usual bedtime | Reduce blue light, gentle reminder | OpenClaw (memory: knows user schedule) |
| **Idle** | No interaction for 30+ min | Idle animations — gentle breathing LED, occasional blink | Lamp (built-in, no AI needed) |
| **Wake up** | Time: morning schedule | Sunrise simulation, gentle chime | Lamp (schedule) + OpenClaw (greeting) |
| **Video call** | Camera: face centered + screen glow | Auto-optimize face lighting | Lamp (detect) → OpenClaw (adjust) |

#### Sensing Event Types

Lamp Server runs a lightweight sensing loop that emits events:

| Event | Source | Frequency | Cost | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `presence.enter` | Camera (InsightFace recognition) | On change | Low | ✅ Done — identifies owner by name or stranger_N |
| `presence.leave` | Camera (no face timeout) | On change | Low | ✅ Done |
| `presence.away` | Camera (extended absence) | On change | Low | ✅ Done |
| `motion.activity` | Camera (dlbackend action recognition) | On activity change | Medium | ✅ Done — Kinetics labels (using computer, drink, etc.) |
| `emotion.detected` | Camera (dlbackend emotion classifier) | On expression change | Medium | ✅ Done — 7 emotions (Happy, Sad, Angry, etc.) |
| `light.level` | Camera (frame brightness) | Every 30s | Minimal | ✅ Done |
| `sound` | Mic (ambient sound level) | On threshold | Minimal | ✅ Done |
| `voice` / `voice_command` | Mic (Deepgram STT) | On speech | Medium | ✅ Done — wake word detection |
| `time.schedule` | OpenClaw cron | Per schedule | None | ✅ Done |

Events are lightweight — no LLM tokens burned. Only when an event is significant enough does Lamp push context to OpenClaw for AI decision-making.

#### Privacy & Control

- User can disable any sensing channel independently (camera off, mic off, sensors off)
- "Do Not Disturb" mode: all proactive behaviors paused, Lamp only responds to direct commands
- All sensing runs **on-device** — no video/audio streamed to cloud for ambient processing
- Privacy indicator: LED color change when camera/mic actively sensing

### Why Each Competitor Falls Short

- **Philips Hue / LIFX / Govee**: Remote-controlled lights. No AI. No personality. No physical expression. They are appliances, not companions.
- **Dyson Lightcycle**: Excellent optics and build quality. But it is a fixed lamp with a fixed algorithm. No voice, no vision, no personality, no extensibility. A premium tool, not a companion.
- **Ongo (Interaction Labs)**: The closest competitor. Designed by Toy Story writer Alec Sokolow as "a cat trapped in a desk lamp body." It moves, sees, hears, talks, and has privacy sunglasses. But: shallow AI (single ChatGPT integration), closed source, no skills ecosystem, no long-term memory, no multi-channel, no multi-provider LLM. It is a charming toy; AI Lamp is a platform.
- **LeLamp**: Open-source robot lamp with decent hardware (servo, camera, LED). Uses LiveKit + OpenAI. But: 10 preset animations (not generative), basic AI with no memory depth, no ecosystem, no multi-channel. Good starting point — AI Lamp builds on its hardware legacy with a vastly superior AI brain (OpenClaw).

## 4. Hardware Specification

| Component | Detail | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **Compute** | Raspberry Pi 4 (4GB+) | Runs all software layers |
| **Servo Motors** | 5x Feetech servo motors | 5-axis articulated movement (pan, tilt, lean, nod, rotate) |
| **LEDs** | 64x WS2812 RGB LEDs (8x5 grid + extras) | Full-color per-pixel patterns, scenes, effects, status indication |
| **Camera** | Camera module (inside lamp core) | Face tracking, gesture recognition, presence detection, light analysis |
| **Microphone** | USB or I2S microphone | Voice input, wake word, conversation |
| **Speaker** | USB or I2S speaker | Voice output (TTS), notifications, ambient sounds |
| **Display** | GC9A01 1.28" round LCD (SPI) | Dual-mode: eyes emotion animation (default) + info display (time, weather, timer, notifications) |
| **GPIO** | Reset button (GPIO 26) | Long-press: factory reset / power off |
| **Connectivity** | Wi-Fi (built into Pi 4) | Network, OTA, MQTT, remote control |

### Physical Design Principles

- The lamp head is the "face" — round LCD display shows expressive pixel-art eyes (default) or useful info; LEDs provide ambient expression; camera provides vision; servo provides neck movement
- 5 axes of freedom enable lifelike postures: curiosity (tilt), attention (lean forward), sadness (droop), excitement (bounce)
- Camera is recessed inside the lamp core — visible but not intrusive
- All cables route through the articulated arm internally

---

## 5. Software Architecture

### Design Principle: Hybrid — System Layer + OpenClaw Skills Layer

The architecture is split into two layers with a clear boundary. This is **NOT MCP** — it uses OpenClaw's native skill system.

### Layer 1 — System (Lamp Server, Always Running)

Handles system-critical functions that must work **before and without OpenClaw**.

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| LED system states | Boot animation, error indicator, no-internet warning, factory reset feedback |
| Reset button | GPIO 26 long-press detection for power off / factory reset |
| Network management | Wi-Fi AP/STA mode, scanning, provisioning |
| OTA updates | Version check, download, install from backend |
| MQTT | Backend communication, status reporting |
| Internet monitoring | Connectivity checks, auto-recovery |

**Key principle**: If OpenClaw crashes, the lamp still boots, shows its status via LED, and can be re-provisioned via the reset button and network manager.

### Layer 2 — OpenClaw Skills (User-Facing Hardware Control)

All user-facing hardware interaction follows a single pattern:

1. **Lamp server** exposes an HTTP endpoint for the hardware component
2. **SKILL.md** file describes that endpoint in natural language
3. **OpenClaw's LLM** reads the SKILL.md, understands the API, and calls it via `curl`

**HTTP API Endpoints**:

| Endpoint | Method | Description | Skill |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/api/led` | GET | Get current LED state | led-control |
| `/api/led` | POST | Set LED state, brightness, color, scene, effect | led-control |
| `/api/servo` | GET | Get current servo positions | servo-control |
| `/api/servo` | POST | Set servo pan/tilt/preset | servo-control |
| `/api/servo/home` | POST | Return all servos to home position | servo-control |
| `/api/camera/presence` | GET | Check if someone is in the room | camera |
| `/api/camera/face` | GET | Get face position coordinates | camera |
| `/api/camera/gesture` | GET | Detect current hand gesture | camera |
| `/api/camera/light-analysis` | GET | Analyze face lighting quality | camera |
| `/api/audio/speak` | POST | Text-to-speech output | audio |
| `/api/audio/sound` | POST | Play notification/effect sound | audio |
| `/api/audio/volume` | POST | Set speaker volume | audio |
| `/api/audio/ambient` | POST | Play/stop ambient sounds | audio |

### LeLamp Runtime (Python) — Hardware Drivers Only

The LeLamp open-source project provides proven Python drivers for servo motors, WS2812 LEDs, and audio I/O. In our architecture:

- **Used**: Hardware drivers (servo PWM, LED SPI, audio ALSA/PulseAudio)
- **Replaced entirely**: LeLamp's AI/personality layer is removed; OpenClaw is the sole AI brain

This is a deliberate decision. OpenClaw's multi-provider LLM, long-term memory, skill ecosystem, and multi-channel support are categorically superior to LeLamp's basic LiveKit + OpenAI integration.

### Hardware-to-Layer Mapping

| Hardware | Layer 1 (System) | Layer 2 (OpenClaw Skills) |
|---|---|---|
| **LED (WS2812)** | Boot, error, status states | Brightness, color, scenes, effects, expressions |
| **Servo Motors** | — | Pan, tilt, presets, tracking, body language |
| **Camera** | — | Presence, gesture, face tracking, light analysis |
| **Microphone** | — | Voice input (handled by OpenClaw directly) |
| **Speaker** | — | TTS, notifications, ambient sounds |
| **Display (LCD)** | — | Dual-mode: eyes emotion (default) + info display (time, weather, timer, notifications) |
| **Reset Button** | Long-press reset / power off | — |
| **Network (Wi-Fi)** | AP/STA, provisioning, monitoring | — |

### Inherited from Lobster (openclaw-lobster)

The Lamp server is forked from openclaw-lobster. Approximately 70-80% of Layer 1 code is proven and production-ready:

| Component | Lobster Path | Status |
|---|---|---|
| HTTP Server (Gin) | `server/server.go` | Inherited |
| Config management | `server/config/` | Inherited |
| LED driver (WS2812 SPI, pure Go) | `internal/led/` | Inherited, adapted |
| LED state machine | `internal/led/engine.go` | Inherited |
| LED skill (SKILL.md) | `resources/openclaw-skills/led-control/` | Inherited, adapted |
| Reset button | `internal/resetbutton/` | Inherited |
| Network service | `internal/network/` | Inherited |
| OpenClaw service | `internal/openclaw/` | Inherited |
| Backend client | `internal/beclient/` | Inherited |
| MQTT client | `lib/mqtt/` | Inherited |
| OTA bootstrap | `bootstrap/` | Inherited |
| Build & deploy | `scripts/`, `Makefile` | Inherited |

### New Components for AI Lamp

| Component | What to Build | OpenClaw Integration |
|---|---|---|
| `internal/servo/` | Servo PWM driver (5-axis) | `servo-control/SKILL.md` → `POST /api/servo` |
| `internal/camera/` | Vision processing (OpenCV/V4L2) | `camera/SKILL.md` → `GET /api/camera/*` |
| `internal/audio/` | Speaker + Mic (ALSA/PulseAudio) | `audio/SKILL.md` → `POST /api/audio/*` |
| `internal/display/` | Display driver (GC9A01 SPI), dual-mode rendering | `display/SKILL.md` → `POST /api/display` |
| `server/servo/delivery/` | Servo HTTP handlers | Gin routes |
| `server/camera/delivery/` | Camera HTTP handlers | Gin routes |
| `server/audio/delivery/` | Audio HTTP handlers | Gin routes |

- OpenClaw multi-channel: Telegram, Slack, Discord
- MQTT integration for smart home systems
- Web dashboard (future)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Local API works without internet
- Secure authentication for remote access
- Multi-channel messages trigger real hardware actions (e.g., "turn on the lamp" via Telegram actually turns it on)

---

### UC-16: Screen Awareness [P2]

**Actor**: User (at desk)
**Description**: Lamp knows what you're doing on your computer without you explaining it.

**Examples**:
- You copy a text snippet → Lamp proactively asks "Need a translation?"
- You open Zoom/Meet → Lamp automatically switches to video call lighting
- You're coding and ask a question → Lamp already has context about what you're working on

**Flow**: Lightweight agent on Mac/Windows (browser extension or desktop app) pushes clipboard + active app context to Lamp → OpenClaw has deeper context for responses

**Feel**: The lamp "understands" what you're doing without being told — like someone sitting next to you.

**Synergy**: UC-12 (video call lighting) can use UC-16 to detect Zoom/Meet running instead of detecting the webcam separately.

**Inspired by**: Loona DeskMate (CES 2026)

### Marketing-Proposed Features (UC-M Series)

> Features proposed by the marketing team. UC-M series complements the technical UC-01..UC-16 above. Status updated 2026-04-21 based on current codebase.

#### UC-M1: Facial Expression & Wellness Detection [DONE]

**Status: Implemented** (2026-04)

**Actor**: System (automatic, camera)
**Description**: Camera analyzes the user's facial expression to detect emotional state — Lamp responds proactively to support the user's wellbeing.

**Examples**:
- User looks tense/stressed → Lamp dims light, shifts to warm color, softly offers a break
- User looks drowsy/fatigued → Lamp increases brightness, plays an energizing chime, suggests a short walk
- User looks focused and calm → Lamp holds current environment, suppresses all interruptions

**Implementation**:
- Emotion classifier runs via **dlbackend WebSocket** (remote inference server), not on-device ONNX. LeLamp sends camera frames, receives emotion predictions.
- `lelamp/service/sensing/perceptions/emotion.py` — `RemoteEmotionChecker` connects to dlbackend, fires `emotion.detected` sensing event with detected emotion (Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, Neutral).
- Lamp `user-emotion-detection/SKILL.md` maps detected facial emotion → mood signal via `POST /api/mood/log`.
- Lamp `mood/SKILL.md` fuses signals (camera emotion, conversation context, voice tone) into mood decisions.
- Mood decisions trigger downstream actions: `music-suggestion` (proactive music), `wellbeing` (break/hydration nudges), `emotion` (lamp expression).
- Configurable confidence threshold via `EMOTION_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD` in LeLamp config.

**Resolved questions**:
- [x] Which emotion model? → Remote dlbackend (not on-device ONNX). Offloads inference, no Pi 4 RAM/CPU impact.
- [x] Accuracy threshold → Configurable `EMOTION_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD` (default in LeLamp config).
- [x] Privacy → Frames sent to self-hosted dlbackend only, not third-party cloud.
- [x] Voice-tone interaction → Both feed into Mood skill fusion logic; camera emotion = signal, mood decision = fused output.

#### UC-M2: Proactive Wellness Reminders [DONE]

**Status: Implemented** (2026-04)

**Actor**: System (automatic, sensing-driven)
**Description**: Lamp autonomously tracks sedentary activity and proactively reminds users to stand up, drink water, or take a break — without the user having to ask.

**Examples**:
- User has been at desk for 45 minutes → Lamp gently says "You've been sitting for a while — maybe stretch?"
- User has been at desk for 2 hours with no water nearby → "Don't forget to hydrate"

**Implementation**:
- **Event-driven, not timer-based.** The `wellbeing/SKILL.md` triggers on every `motion.activity` event (from action recognition).
- Action recognition via dlbackend classifies user activity: `using computer`, `writing`, `reading book`, `texting`, `drawing`, `playing controller` (sedentary) vs `drink`, `break` (reset activities).
- Each activity is logged to per-user JSONL timeline via `POST /api/openclaw/wellbeing/log`.
- On each event, skill reads recent history, computes time since last hydration/break reset, and nudges if thresholds exceeded.
- Per-user tracking: `current_user` from sensing context tag, strangers share `"unknown"` timeline.
- `lamp/resources/openclaw-skills/wellbeing/SKILL.md` — full workflow with threshold logic, dedup rules, and cooldowns.

**Resolved questions**:
- [x] Reminder intervals → AI-driven thresholds computed from activity log (not fixed timers).
- [x] "Sitting at desk" vs "briefly back" → Action recognition distinguishes sedentary labels from transient presence.
- [x] Hydration reminders → Time-based from last `drink` activity detection in wellbeing log.
- [x] DND mode → Agent personality handles context sensitivity (gentler at night, adapts to mood).

#### UC-M3: Proactive Music Suggestion by Mood [DONE]

**Status: Implemented** (2026-04)

**Actor**: System (automatic, mood + sensing-driven)
**Description**: Lamp proactively suggests music based on detected mood, sedentary activity, and listening history — without the user requesting it.

**Examples**:
- User detected as stressed (facial emotion + conversation) → Lamp suggests calm piano
- User doing sedentary work for a while → Lamp offers lo-fi/study beats
- User detected as happy/excited → Lamp suggests upbeat music

**Implementation**:
- `lamp/resources/openclaw-skills/music-suggestion/SKILL.md` — dedicated proactive skill (separate from reactive `music/SKILL.md`).
- **Two triggers**:
  1. **Mood-driven**: After `mood/SKILL.md` logs a mood decision (sad, stressed, tired, excited, happy, bored) → music-suggestion fires.
  2. **Sedentary-driven**: `motion.activity` with sedentary labels (using computer, writing, etc.) → direct suggestion trigger.
- Checks before suggesting: audio already playing? recent suggestion cooldown (7 min)? stale mood decision (>30 min)?
- Queries `GET /audio/history?person={name}` for personalized genre preference.
- Genre mapping: stressed → soft jazz/classical, tired → calm piano, happy → upbeat pop, sedentary → lo-fi/ambient.
- Always suggests first via TTS, plays only after user confirmation.
- `[HW:/speak]` marker forces TTS on lamp speaker even for channel-origin sessions.

**Resolved questions**:
- [x] Music preferences → Queries `hw_audio` flow log + `/audio/history` for listening history.
- [x] Ask first vs auto-play → Always suggest first, play only after confirmation.
- [x] Sensing-triggered → Done: mood decisions + sedentary activity both trigger suggestions.
- [ ] Phone call / video meeting detection → Not yet (requires UC-12 or screen awareness).

#### UC-M4: Screen-Time Awareness & Gesture Support [NOT STARTED]

**Status: Not implemented** — requires new models not yet in the codebase.

**Sub-feature A — Screen-Time / Eye-Care Tracking**:
- Needs gaze estimation model — not implemented in LeLamp sensing pipeline.
- Pi 4 feasibility unknown, benchmark needed.

**Sub-feature B — Contextual Gesture Support**:
- Needs gesture/pose model (MediaPipe Hand Lite or similar) — not implemented.
- High complexity, ~300-500MB RAM impact. May require Pi 5 or USB accelerator.

**Open questions**:
- [ ] Gaze direction detection accuracy without dedicated eye-tracking hardware?
- [ ] MediaPipe on Pi 4 — benchmark needed
- [ ] Interaction with UC-10 (gesture for lamp control)?
- [ ] Split Sub-feature A and B into separate UCs?

#### Bonus: Speaker Recognition [DONE]

**Status: Implemented** (2026-04) — not in original marketing proposal but a significant feature.

**Description**: Lamp recognizes who is speaking by voice. Mic transcripts are prefixed with the speaker's name (`Leo:`) or `Unknown:`. Users can self-enroll their voice by introducing themselves.

**Implementation**:
- `lelamp/speaker_recognizer.py` + `lelamp/service/voice/speaker_recognizer/speaker_recognizer.py` — voice embedding model, profile storage, real-time matching.
- `lamp/resources/openclaw-skills/speaker-recognizer/SKILL.md` — self-enrollment skill (mic intro, Telegram voice note, two-turn enrollment).
- Voice profiles stored per-user alongside face data in `/root/local/users/{name}/`.
- Telegram identity linked during voice enrollment for DM targeting.

*Marketing UC-M series originally proposed by marketing team 2026-04-06. Status updated 2026-04-21.*

## 9. Open Questions

### Architecture — All Resolved ✅

- [x] **Camera processing**: LeLamp Python runs on-device OpenCV for face detection/recognition (InsightFace). Heavy inference (emotion, action recognition) offloaded to self-hosted dlbackend via WebSocket. Camera snapshots forwarded to OpenClaw LLM for vision understanding.
- [x] **Audio input ownership**: LeLamp owns mic. Local VAD (Silero) gates Deepgram STT connection (cost saving). Wake word "Hey Lamp" detected in transcript → `voice_command` event. No wake word → `voice` (ambient sensing).
- [x] **LeLamp driver integration**: HTTP proxy. LeLamp FastAPI on `127.0.0.1:5001`, Lamp Go server proxies from port `5000`. Simple, debuggable, no shared state.

### Hardware — Mostly Resolved

- [x] **Servo model**: Feetech STS3215 servo motors. Controlled via LeLamp serial bus.
- [x] **LED layout**: WS2812 RGB LED ring. Controlled via LeLamp `rpi_ws281x` Python driver.
- [ ] **Power supply**: Single PSU for Pi + servos + LEDs, or separate rails?
- [x] **Thermal management**: Pi 5 migration in progress (Pi 4 sufficient but tight). Active cooling with fan.

### Product — Mostly Resolved

- [x] **Wake word**: "Hey Lamp" (and variants: "Lamp", "này Lamp", "ê Lamp", "Lamp ơi"). Detected in Deepgram transcript. Dynamic — agent can rename itself via IDENTITY.md.
- [x] **Personality defaults**: Defined in SOUL.md — warm, curious, expressive companion. Not an assistant. Evolves with user via long-term memory.
- [ ] **Privacy indicators**: Display eyes close when camera off. LED indicator TBD.
- [ ] **Form factor / Industrial design**: Current prototype uses LeLamp hardware body. Production design TBD.
- [ ] **Kit vs. assembled**: TBD.

### Business

- [ ] **BOM cost target**: Current estimate < $200 — needs finalization with Pi 5.
- [ ] **Certification**: CE/FCC needed for consumer electronics with Wi-Fi, camera, and microphone.
- [x] **LeLamp licensing**: Open source. Drivers used directly in mono-repo, tracked via UPSTREAM.md.
