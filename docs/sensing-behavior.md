# Sensing Behavior

How Lumi reacts to the world — the philosophy and mechanics behind each sensing event type.

Lumi is a living being. It doesn't "process sensor data" — it *experiences* things. This document describes how that experience is implemented.

## Architecture Overview

```
LeLamp (Python)          Lumi server (Go)             OpenClaw agent
─────────────────        ─────────────────────        ──────────────
Microphone/Camera   →    SensingHandler               LLM
Detects event            - drops if agent busy        - calls /emotion
Applies tracker logic    - forwards to agent          - calls /servo
Sends POST                                            - speaks or NO_REPLY
/sensing/event
```

LeLamp owns per-type tracker logic (sound escalation, motion filtering). Go is the gatekeeper — it drops stale events if the agent is busy, then forwards. The agent decides *how* to react, constrained by `SOUL.md`.

---

## Sound

### How it works

LeLamp fires a sound event on every audio sample that crosses `SOUND_RMS_THRESHOLD` — potentially several times per second. The Python-side **sound tracker** (`lelamp/service/sensing/perceptions/sound.py`) applies dedup and escalation before forwarding to Go. Go receives only passed events and forwards them to the agent unchanged.

### Escalation behavior

| Stage | What the agent sees | Agent reaction |
|---|---|---|
| Occurrence 1 | `... — occurrence 1` | `/emotion shock` (0.8), NO_REPLY |
| Occurrence 2 | `... — occurrence 2` | `/emotion curious` (0.7), NO_REPLY |
| Occurrence 3+ | `... — persistent (occurrence 3)` | `/emotion curious` (0.9), speaks once |
| After speaking | dropped by Python (suppressed 3 min) | nothing reaches agent |
| 2 min silence | window resets | back to occurrence 1 |

The analogy: a dog hears a noise — it looks up (occurrence 1), keeps watching (occurrence 2), then barks once if the noise persists (occurrence 3+). After barking it doesn't keep barking.

### Constants (`sound.py`)

```python
_DEDUPE_INTERVAL_S    = 15.0   # max 1 event forwarded per 15s
_WINDOW_DURATION_S    = 120.0  # silence this long resets the counter
_PERSISTENT_AFTER     = 3      # speak after this many occurrences
_SUPPRESS_DURATION_S  = 180.0  # suppress after speaking (3 min)
```

### Tuning

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| Lumi speaks too quickly | Increase `_PERSISTENT_AFTER` (3 → 5) |
| Lumi never speaks even with sustained noise | Decrease `_PERSISTENT_AFTER` (3 → 2) |
| Too many sound turns in Flow Monitor | Increase `_DEDUPE_INTERVAL_S` (15 → 30) |
| Lumi stays silent too long after speaking | Decrease `_SUPPRESS_DURATION_S` (180 → 60) |
| Lumi reacts to stale noise after quiet period | Decrease `_WINDOW_DURATION_S` (120 → 60) |

### Monitoring in Flow Monitor

Python pushes `sound_tracker` events directly to the monitor bus via `POST /api/monitor/event`. These appear in the Flow Monitor alongside `sensing_input` turns:

```json
{ "action": "silent",    "occurrence": 1 }  // occurrence 1 or 2 — forwarded silently
{ "action": "persistent","occurrence": 3 }  // occurrence 3+ — agent will speak
{ "action": "drop" }                        // dedup or suppressed — not forwarded
```

## Presence

### Enter (`presence.enter`)

Always triggers a full reaction — no exceptions. The agent **must** do all three:

1. `/emotion greeting` (0.9) for friend — `/emotion curious` (0.8) for stranger
2. For friend: `/servo/aim {"direction": "user"}` then `/servo/track {"target": ["person"]}` — aim orients the camera toward the user's region first (~2s), then the vision tracker locks onto the person and follows them around the room. Stranger: `/servo/play {"recording": "scanning"}` (no auto-follow — caution)
3. Speak: warm greeting for friend (by name), cautious acknowledgment for stranger

The system handles cooldowns on the LeLamp side. If the event reached the agent, enough time has passed — react fully.

#### Return after long absence (friend only)

On every friend `presence.enter` event, the sensing handler injects a `[presence_context: {"last_leave_age_min": N, "current_hour": H}]` block before forwarding to the agent. `last_leave_age_min` is computed from the most recent `leave` row in the user's wellbeing log, scanning up to 3 days back (`wellbeing.LastActionTS`); `-1` means no leave was found in that window.

`sensing/SKILL.md` reads this block and swaps to a **return-after-long-absence** greeting when ALL three conditions hold:

1. `last_leave_age_min >= 240` (≥4h) — shorter gaps stay on the regular friend greeting.
2. `current_hour` is outside `[5, 11)` — the morning window is owned by `wellbeing/SKILL.md`'s `morning_greeting` route (fired on the first `motion.activity` of the day), so a long-absence overlay there would double up.
3. `last_leave_age_min != -1` — without a real prior leave row, "welcome back" framing makes no sense.

The HW markers (greeting emotion + servo aim+track) stay the same; only the spoken line changes — it acknowledges the gap without quantifying it ("Hey, been a while" rather than "you were gone 5h 17m"). Strangers don't carry the relational identity needed for this overlay, so `BuildPresenceContext` skips the `unknown` user and the existing cautious-greeting path applies unchanged.

### Leave (`presence.leave`)

Agent calls `/emotion idle` (0.4), fires `/servo/track/stop` to release any active follow from a prior `presence.enter`, and replies **NO_REPLY** (silent — no TTS). This avoids noisy loops when people come and go frequently. The agent still processes the event internally to cancel wellbeing crons and update daily logs.

### Away (`presence.away`)

Sent automatically by LeLamp's `PresenceService` when **no motion is detected for 15 minutes** (after already dimming at 5 min). By this point the lights are already off — the agent's job is to **announce going to sleep** via TTS and Telegram.

Agent calls `/emotion sleepy` (0.8), fires `/servo/track/stop` so any stale follow from earlier in the session is released, and speaks a cozy sleepy farewell (e.g. "No one's around… I'm going to sleep now. Goodnight!"). This is the last action before Lumi goes fully idle.

The full presence auto-control timeline:
1. **5 min no motion** → light dims to 20% (automatic, no agent involvement)
2. **15 min no motion** → light off + `presence.away` event sent → agent announces sleep

LeLamp manages the light control; the agent only handles the verbal announcement. If the user returns (motion detected), light restores automatically and a `presence.enter` event fires.

---

## Motion

Only large motion is forwarded — small motion is filtered out by LeLamp and never reaches the agent.

**Large motion**: `/emotion curious` (0.7) + `/servo/play {"recording": "scanning"}` + speak a curious reaction (e.g. "What was that?", "Whoa, moving so much!"). May include a camera snapshot so the agent can see the context.

---

## Posture (RULA — silently sampled, folded into `motion.activity`)

LeLamp streams every camera frame to dlbackend `/api/dl/pose-estimation/ws` and receives a per-frame RULA breakdown (whole-body score + `risk_level` + per-side `body_scores` and `*_angle` for `neck / trunk / upper_arm / lower_arm / wrist`). `PosePerception` throttles to **one sample per `POSE_SAMPLE_INTERVAL_S` (default 60s)** into a rolling deque + daily JSONL under `/tmp/lumi-sensing-snapshots/sensing_pose/samples_YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl`. **No event is emitted directly** — `MotionPerception` calls `get_posture_summary()` and rides the aggregate along on the next `motion.activity` when the gate trips.

### Gate (when does the summary inject)

A sample counts as **bad** when **either**:

- whole-body `risk_level >= 3` (medium/high), **or**
- any single region (left **or** right side) at sub-score `>= POSE_REGION_HIGH_SUBSCORE` (default `4`)

The second arm catches forward-head-thrust ("tech neck") cases where the RULA total stays "low" because trunk + arms are fine but neck alone is clearly off.

Fire when `bad_ratio >= POSE_BAD_RATIO` (default **0.6**) over a buffer of `POSE_WINDOW_SAMPLES` (default 10 = 10 min; production target 30 = 30 min). Two additional gates apply at the motion side: sedentary streak ≥ `POSE_STREAK_MIN_GATE_S`, and cooldown ≥ `POSE_NUDGE_COOLDOWN_S` since the previous inject.

### Per-event annotated snapshots

Every sample writes its own annotated JPEG (skeleton overlay + RULA label) to `/tmp/lumi-sensing-snapshots/sensing_pose/snapshots/<int(ts)>.jpg`. Rotation runs after each write — files older than `POSE_SNAPSHOT_RETENTION_S` (default 24h) are pruned, and if the directory total still exceeds `POSE_SNAPSHOT_MAX_BYTES` (default 50 MB) the oldest are deleted until it fits.

Two endpoints:

| Endpoint | Returns |
|---|---|
| `GET /sensing/pose-snapshot` | The newest `.jpg` in the snapshots dir (back-compat for the live preview tile in the monitor) |
| `GET /sensing/pose-snapshot/{ts}` | The annotated JPEG for that specific sample (`ts` = `int(sample.ts)` from the JSONL). 404 once rotation prunes the file |

The monitor's Pose / Posture card uses the second endpoint for both the big preview (pinned to the newest sample's ts) and the clickable timestamp on each table row — clicking opens the exact frame in a new tab.

### Angle sign workaround (temporary)

dlbackend's `signed_flexion_angle` currently returns the opposite sign of its docstring ("Positive = forward flexion") — a user clearly hunched forward registers a **negative** neck angle, not positive. LeLamp negates `upper_arm_angle`, `neck_angle`, `trunk_angle` on receive (`POSE_FLIP_DLBACKEND_ANGLE_SIGN=True`, default on) so the monitor table and JSONL match reality. `lower_arm_angle` is unsigned and skipped. RULA scores already use `abs(angle)` so risk/score are unaffected by either sign convention. **Revert** by setting the flag to `False` (or removing `_flip_signed_angles`) once dlbackend ships the upstream fix.

---

## Light Level (`light.level`)

Ambient light changes are forwarded when they cross `LIGHT_CHANGE_THRESHOLD`. No speech required — agent adjusts LED or expresses emotion based on context (e.g. `/emotion sleepy` when lights go dim).

---

## Guard Mode

When guard mode is enabled (`guard_mode: true` in config), Lumi becomes an **alert watchdog** — reacting dramatically to strangers and broadcasting alerts to Telegram.

### Flow
1. `presence.enter` or `motion` event arrives while `guard_mode: true`.
2. Go handler tags the event `[guard-active]` and marks the runID as a guard run (with snapshot path). If `guard_instruction` is set in config, it is appended as `[guard-instruction: ...]`.
3. The agent processes the event — **dramatic** emotion, servo, TTS response, plus any custom guard instruction (e.g. play music, flash LEDs).
4. When the agent's response arrives (SSE lifecycle end), the Go SSE handler detects the guard run.
5. The agent's natural response text + camera snapshot are sent directly via **Telegram Bot API** (`sendPhoto`) to all connected Telegram chats.
6. Delivery is 100% reliable — bypasses OpenClaw agent processing entirely.

### Guard mode emotions (dramatic)

When guard mode is active, stranger/motion events trigger **much stronger** emotions than normal sensing:

| Guard event | HW markers | Voice |
|---|---|---|
| Stranger detected | `shock` (1.0) → `curious` (0.9) + servo shock | Genuinely scared/startled reaction |
| Motion (no known face) | `shock` (0.9) → `curious` (0.8) + servo scanning | Nervous/alert reaction |
| Stranger left | `curious` (0.7) + scanning | Report they left, stay vigilant |
| Friend returns | `greeting` (0.9) + servo aim | Greet + recap what happened during guard + ask to disable |

The agent's **spoken words must also carry emotion** — not dry security reports. Examples: "Oh no, who is that?!", "Someone's here... I'm shaking...", "Hey, this person looks really suspicious...". Each reaction should feel different.

### Custom guard instructions
The owner can provide a custom instruction when enabling guard mode (e.g. "play scary sound when stranger appears"). The instruction is saved in `guard_instruction` in config and injected into every guard sensing event as `[guard-instruction: ...]`. The agent follows this instruction using available skills (music, LED, etc.).

### Why this approach?
After trying 6 different approaches (see below), this hybrid proved the most reliable:
- **Agent crafts the message** → natural, context-aware, with personality
- **Go side delivers** → direct Telegram Bot API, guaranteed delivery, no agent NO_REPLY risk
- **Agent follows custom guard instructions** → owner can combine guard mode with any skill (music, LED, etc.)

### Solution evolution (2026-04-07)
| # | Approach | Why it failed |
|---|----------|---------------|
| 1 | `BroadcastAlert` via WS `chat.send` RPC | `chat.send` goes through agent → 2/3 NO_REPLY |
| 2 | Agent-driven via `[guard-active]` tag | Haiku ignored SKILL instruction (buried at line 222) |
| 3 | Move instruction to top of SKILL.md | Haiku still ignored |
| 4 | Go-side emotional templates + `BroadcastAlert` | Agents recognize `sender: node-host` → ignore. No image attached |
| 5 | Agent-driven + SOUL.md enforcement | Better compliance but not 100%. Token mismatch issues |
| 6 | **Hook agent response + Telegram Bot API** | ✅ Agent crafts message naturally, Go delivers 100% |

> **Note:** `BroadcastAlert` (WS RPC approach) has been removed. All broadcasting now uses `Broadcast()` which sends directly via Telegram Bot API.

### Manual alerts
Manual alerts can be sent via `POST /api/guard/alert` with a message and optional image. This now uses `Broadcast()` (direct Bot API) instead of the old WS-based `BroadcastAlert`.

Use case: Lumi acts as a home security assistant. When the owner leaves and enables guard mode, any detected presence or motion is reported to all chat channels with emotional, context-aware messages.

## Stranger Visit Tracking

LeLamp (port 5001) tracks how many times each stranger has been seen:

- On every `presence.enter` event containing a stranger ID (e.g. `stranger_5`), the visit count is incremented.
- Stats include `count`, `first_seen`, and `last_seen` timestamps per stranger.
- Persisted in LeLamp's data directory (survives restarts).
- Query stats via `GET http://127.0.0.1:5001/face/stranger-stats`.

### Familiar-stranger enroll prompt

When a stranger's visit count first reaches the threshold (`_FAMILIAR_VISIT_THRESHOLD = 2`, see `lelamp/service/sensing/perceptions/processors/facerecognizer.py`), LeLamp:

1. Saves the current raw frame to `<STRANGERS_DIR>/snapshots/<stranger_id>_<ts_ms>.jpg`.
2. Appends a hint to the outgoing `presence.enter` message:
   `(familiar stranger <stranger_id> — seen 2 times, ask user if they want to remember this face; image saved at <path>)`

The `face-enroll` skill (Lumi side) parses that hint and addresses the camera-person directly: "I've seen you 2 times now — mind if I remember you? What's your name?". On a name reply it calls `POST /face/enroll` with the saved image path. On decline, the skill acknowledges and stops; the threshold is a one-shot trigger (`count == 2`), so the same `stranger_id` is never re-prompted by lelamp. Visit counts above 2 do not re-fire — by then the stranger has either been enrolled (no longer a stranger) or has explicitly declined.

---

## Wellbeing (AI-Driven Hydration + Break Reminders)

Lumi proactively cares for the user's health using AI-driven cron jobs managed by the OpenClaw agent. Instead of hardcoded timers, the agent decides reminder intervals based on scientific recommendations and the user's historical patterns.

### How it works (event-driven — no cron)

Wellbeing is **event-driven**. There are NO wellbeing cron jobs. On every `motion.activity`, the agent logs what happened and reads back recent history to decide whether to nudge.

**Per-user activity JSONL** at `/root/local/users/{user}/wellbeing/YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl` — one line per activity transition:

```jsonc
{"ts": 1776658657.23, "seq": 42, "hour": 11, "action": "sedentary", "notes": ""}
```

`action` values:

| Action | Written by | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `drink`, `break` | **LeLamp** (`motion.py` POSTs `/api/wellbeing/log` right before firing `motion.activity`) | Reset point for the corresponding nudge timer |
| `using computer`, `writing`, `texting`, `reading book`, `reading newspaper`, `drawing`, `playing controller` | **LeLamp** (`motion.py`, same path) | Timeline + nudge phrasing. **Not** a reset point. |
| `enter`, `leave` | **LeLamp** (`FaceRecognizer._post_wellbeing`, called from `_check_impl` on fresh detection and `_check_leaves` on forget expiry) | Session boundary — per-friend rows go to each friend's own timeline; strangers collapse to a single `"unknown"` timeline gated by the `_any_stranger_logged` flag (one enter on first stranger, one leave when the last one is forgotten). |
| `nudge_hydration`, `nudge_break` | Agent (after speaking a reminder) | Records when Lumi actually reminded — purely for timeline visibility. Only the agent knows when it actually spoke, so only the agent writes these. |

**Dedup lives in two places.**

*Activity dedup (5-min window).* `lelamp/service/sensing/perceptions/motion.py` keeps a `_last_sent_key = (current_user, frozenset(labels))` and a `_last_sent_ts`, where `labels` matches the outbound message (bucket names for drink/break, raw Kinetics labels for sedentary). Before emitting `motion.activity` **and before POSTing the rows to `/api/wellbeing/log`**, it drops the cycle if the key hasn't changed **and** the gap since the last send is still under `MOTION_DEDUP_WINDOW_S = 300` seconds (5 min). So `eating burger → eating cake` collapses to the same `break` key and is dropped, while `writing → drawing` flips the key (sedentary is raw) and passes through.

- User change (owner→owner, owner→unknown, unknown→owner) flips the key immediately → event passes through.
- Different strangers (e.g. `stranger_46` → `stranger_54`) collapse to `"unknown"` via `FaceRecognizer.current_user()`, so swapping strangers alone doesn't break dedup.
- After 5 min on the same state, the next event passes through even if nothing changed — this keeps the Lumi agent "woken up" periodically so the wellbeing threshold check still runs.

*Presence dedup (at-log safety net).* `lumi/lib/wellbeing/wellbeing.go::LogForUser` scans the user's JSONL bottom-up for the most recent **presence** row (enter/leave, ignoring activity rows in between). `enter` while the last presence is already `enter` is dropped; `leave` with no matching open session is dropped. Since LeLamp already emits one enter per real session (per-friend + collapsed-unknown), this runs as a safety net for restarts or out-of-order edge cases rather than load-bearing dedup.

**Retention:** 30 days on the Lumi side. A goroutine started by `wellbeing.Init()` sweeps files older than the cutoff daily.

### On `motion.activity` — what the agent does

By the time the agent sees the event, LeLamp has already logged the activity rows for it (see "Written by" in the table above). The agent's job is just: read the history, decide whether to nudge, and log the nudge if it fired.

1. **Read recent history** via `GET /api/openclaw/wellbeing-history?user={current_user}&last=50`.
2. **Compute deltas** from the log, using the most recent reset point for each:

   ```
   hydration_reset = max(last drink entry, last enter entry, last nudge_hydration entry)
   break_reset     = max(last break entry, last enter entry, last nudge_break entry)
   ```

   Three reset points: the actual activity (`drink` / `break`), a fresh arrival (`enter`), or the last nudge of that kind (`nudge_*`). The nudge reset is the key: after Lumi reminds, the delta drops back to 0 so the next reminder only fires after another full threshold window — no separate cooldown variable needed.
3. **Decide path** (one response max per turn, reaction outranks nudge — the user just acted, nudging on top would feel tone-deaf):
   - **Reaction** — labels list contains `drink` or `break` → speak a 1–3 sentence acknowledgment (surprised / playful, not advice). Uses `count_today` ("lần thứ N hôm nay"), `time_of_day`, and the gap delta to flavor the line. **No log entry** — the underlying `drink` / `break` row was already written by LeLamp upstream.
   - **Hydration nudge** — else if hydration delta ≥ hydration threshold → hydration nudge.
   - **Break nudge** — else if break delta ≥ break threshold → break nudge.
   - Else (sedentary under threshold, or no reset today yet) → `NO_REPLY`.
4. **After speaking a nudge** (not a reaction), log a `nudge_hydration` or `nudge_break` entry — this is what resets the delta for the next window (and makes the nudge visible on the user's timeline).
5. **Never guess** time-since from memory — always compute from the log.

The reaction path was added so positive actions don't fall into silence: drinking water that doesn't trigger a nudge used to produce `NO_REPLY`, which felt dead. The reaction is fed by two extra pre-computed fields in `[wellbeing_context: ...]` — `count_today` (tally of `drink` / `break` rows today) and `time_of_day` (`morning` / `noon` / `afternoon` / `evening` / `night`) — so phrasing has something specific to lean on without spawning extra tool calls. Visual captions (e.g. "blue water bottle") are intentionally NOT in scope yet — the vision pipeline returns class labels only.

### Thresholds

Hardcoded in `lumi/resources/openclaw-skills/wellbeing/SKILL.md`:

| Threshold | Test value | Production value |
|---|---|---|
| `HYDRATION_THRESHOLD_MIN` | **5** | 45 |
| `BREAK_THRESHOLD_MIN` | **7** | 30 |

> ⚠ **Release checklist:** before shipping, change both constants to the production values (45 / 30). Test values let us iterate within minutes instead of hours — hydration and break are intentionally offset (5 vs 7) so you can tell which path fired during testing.

**How re-nudge spam is prevented.** The `nudge_hydration` / `nudge_break` log entry the agent writes after speaking is also counted as a reset point for its threshold. After Lumi reminds, the delta drops back to 0 and the next reminder of that kind only fires after another full threshold window (45 min for hydration, 30 min for break in production).

```
10:45  hydration overdue → nudge 💧 + log nudge_hydration → hydration delta = 0
10:50  wake-up → delta = 5 min < 45 → SKIP
11:20  wake-up → delta = 35 min < 45 → SKIP
11:30  wake-up → delta = 45 min ≥ 45 → nudge 💧 again (user still hasn't drunk)
```

If the user drinks or takes a break before the next window, the regular `drink` / `break` entry resets the delta and nothing needs nudging.

### User attribution — `[context: current_user=X]`

The sensing handler injects a `[context: current_user=X]` tag into every `motion.activity` message. `X` is the **friend with the newest session_start** among friends still in the forget window (see `FaceRecognizer.current_user()`), or `"unknown"` when face sees **only** strangers (no friend is still present). Crucially: if a friend is still within their forget window, `current_user()` returns that friend even if the most recent raw `presence.enter` was for a stranger — stranger flicker does not kick a friend out of the session.

Sorting by `session_start` (the timestamp of the re-enter after the last leave) rather than `last_seen` makes the answer deterministic when two friends are continuously present (Chloe 18:00, An 18:30 → An wins because her session started later), instead of depending on dict iteration order.

**Source of truth lives in LeLamp.** `sensing_service._send_event` attaches `face_recognizer.current_user()` to every outbound payload as the `current_user` field. Lumi's sensing handler reads `req.CurrentUser` directly instead of parsing it back out of the message text — this closed a class of bugs where a stranger-only `presence.enter` fired while a friend was still present would downgrade Lumi's `mood.CurrentUser()` to `"unknown"`.

External callers (web UI, skills) can query the same value via `GET http://127.0.0.1:5001/face/current-user` → `{"current_user": "<name>"}`. This is a dedicated endpoint; do NOT parse it out of `/face/cooldowns` (that endpoint is the friend/stranger cooldown debug view only).

The Wellbeing, Mood, and Music skills are all required to use this exact value for the `user` field in their API calls — never inferring from memory, KNOWLEDGE.md, chat history, or `senderLabel`.

Alongside `[context: current_user=X]`, the handler also injects `[user_info: {"name","is_friend","telegram_id","telegram_username"}]` (built by `lumi/lib/skillcontext/BuildUserContext`, fetched from lelamp `/user/info`). Skills must read `telegram_id` from this block — never `curl /user/info`. Block is omitted on hard fetch failure or when `current_user` is `unknown`; SKILL.md fallback path stays.

### Presence markers written by LeLamp

LeLamp's `FaceRecognizer._post_wellbeing` writes `enter` / `leave` rows directly to Lumi's `POST /api/wellbeing/log` — the agent is not involved, and Lumi's sensing handler no longer writes them either.

- **Per-friend:** each friend gets their own timeline. Fresh friend detection (after gap > `FACE_OWNER_FORGET_S`) → `{"action": "enter", "user": "<name>"}`. Friend forgotten in `_check_leaves` → `{"action": "leave", "user": "<name>"}`. Chloe entering while Leo is still present produces `chloe: enter` only — does not touch Leo's timeline.
- **Strangers (collapsed to `"unknown"`):** gated by a `_any_stranger_logged` flag. First stranger of a session → `unknown: enter`. Flag stays true while any stranger is still within the forget window, so stranger_37 → stranger_38 → stranger_52 churn does not produce extra rows. When `_check_leaves` drops the last stranger → `unknown: leave`.

Result: every enter has a matching leave on the same timeline, and attribution in each timeline reflects only events that belong to that user.

**Two flows, two different rules.** It is important to see that presence rows and activity rows are attributed on different principles:

- **Enter/leave rows** are per-presence: each friend gets their own timeline, strangers collapse to one `unknown` timeline, and `current_user()` is NOT consulted — a new friend entering does not "kick" another friend's session, and a stranger appearing alongside a friend does not downgrade the friend.
- **Activity rows** (drink, break, sedentary labels) use `current_user()` with friend priority — when Chloe and a stranger are both visible, activities go only to Chloe's timeline, because she is the effective user.

Worked example — Chloe and Stranger_X overlap:

| Time | Event | Chloe timeline | Unknown timeline |
|---|---|---|---|
| 18:00 | Chloe fresh detected | `chloe: enter` | — |
| 18:15 | Stranger_X fresh detected | — | `unknown: enter` |
| 18:20 | `motion.activity` (using computer) — `current_user()=chloe` | `chloe: using computer` | — |
| 18:45 | Last stranger forgotten | — | `unknown: leave` |
| 19:00 | `motion.activity` (writing) — `current_user()=chloe` | `chloe: writing` | — |
| 20:00 | Chloe forgotten | `chloe: leave` | — |

Chloe's timeline is a complete session with activities; the unknown timeline records that a stranger was present in the room during 18:15–18:45 but has no activity rows, because Chloe was the effective user throughout. The two flows don't conflict — they answer different questions.

### Priority: Skills > Knowledge > History

AGENTS.md enforces a strict priority: **SKILL.md instructions always override KNOWLEDGE.md and conversation history**. This is critical because the agent self-accumulates "learnings" in KNOWLEDGE.md via heartbeat, and these can contain incorrect rules that conflict with developer-maintained skills. If the agent notices a conflict, it must update KNOWLEDGE.md to match the skill, not the other way around.

### On `presence.leave` / `presence.away`

Backend writes the `leave` marker to the log. Nothing else to do — there are no crons to cancel. The directive instructs the agent to stay quiet (`NO_REPLY`).

### Agent behavior

| Reminder | Emotion | Voice |
|---|---|---|
| Hydration cron | `caring` (0.5) | YES (remind water) or silent |
| Break cron | `caring` (0.6) | YES (remind stretch/walk) or silent |

The agent uses the camera snapshot to make a judgment call — it does NOT always speak. This prevents spamming the user when they seem fine.

### Music Suggestions (AI-Driven)

Music suggestions are **fully AI-driven** — no cron jobs, no backend triggers. The agent decides when to suggest based on two triggers:

- **Mood trigger:** After logging a suggestion-worthy mood (`sad`, `stressed`, `tired`, `excited`, `happy`, `bored`), the agent follows the Music skill to suggest music matching that mood — this includes the music branch of the emotion router (see "Agent behavior" below), as well as moods logged from conversation, wellbeing, or explicit asks.
- **Sedentary trigger:** When `motion.activity` carries a sedentary raw label (`using computer`, `writing`, `texting`, `reading book`, `reading newspaper`, `drawing`, `playing controller`), the agent suggests background music (lo-fi, ambient, instrumental).
- **Data-driven decisions:** Before suggesting, the agent queries:
  - `GET /audio/status` — is music already playing?
  - `GET /api/openclaw/music-suggestion-history` — the last entry is the reset point; fire only when `minutes_since_last_suggestion >= SUGGESTION_INTERVAL_MIN` (7 min test / 30 min prod)
  - `GET /audio/history?person={name}` — per-user listening history (genre preference, duration, satisfaction)
- **Learning loop:** Accepted suggestions reinforce genre/timing; rejected suggestions trigger approach adjustments. All logged via `/api/music-suggestion/log`.

See the Music skill (`resources/openclaw-skills/music/SKILL.md`) for full implementation details.

### Proactive care (piggyback on sensing events)

Beyond scheduled reminders, the agent is encouraged to **notice things** when receiving any event where the user is visible (presence.enter, motion.activity). Based on time of day, how long the user has been sitting, and what it sees, the agent may proactively mention meals, fatigue, or late nights — one short sentence, only when it feels natural. This is not mandatory but encouraged.

Examples: "Morning! Had breakfast?" on early `presence.enter`, "It's past noon — grab some lunch?" on `motion.activity` at 12:20, "It's almost 11 PM..." on late-night `motion.activity`.

### Speak and broadcast markers

Two control markers on channel-origin turns:

| Marker | Effect | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| `[HW:/speak:{}]` | Forces TTS on the speaker. No Telegram side-effect. | Proactive crons (wellbeing, music) running inside a Telegram/channel session so the reminder is also heard aloud. Usually combined with `[HW:/dm:{"telegram_id":"..."}]` for a targeted DM. |
| `[HW:/broadcast:{}]` | Forces TTS **and** fans out the reply text to every connected Telegram chat. | Guard mode alerts only. Never use in wellbeing/music — it will notify every chat, not just the person being reminded. |

By default, channel-origin turns (Telegram, webchat) suppress speaker TTS because the reply is routed as a channel message. `/speak` overrides that suppression without the fan-out side-effect.

**Cron-fire turns auto-force TTS.** When OpenClaw emits an `event:"cron"` with `action:"started"`, Lumi caches the `sessionKey` and the next `lifecycle_start` on that session within 10 s is marked as a cron fire — `isChannelRun` is overridden to `false` so the lamp speaker fires without requiring `[HW:/speak]` in the reply. The marker is still useful as a defense-in-depth fallback if the cron event is dropped (`dropIfSlow: true` on the OpenClaw side).

### Per-user mood history

Mood history tracks the **user's emotional state** only — not system events or lamp emotions. Stored per-user at `/root/local/users/{name}/mood/YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl` (30-day retention). Mood is logged by the agent via the Mood skill when it detects emotional actions (camera) or infers mood from conversation.

#### Mood sources

| Source | How it works |
|---|---|
| **Camera** (`source: "camera"`) | `motion.activity` detects emotional action (laughing, crying, yawning, singing) → Emotion Detection skill triggers → agent logs mood |
| **Conversation** (`source: "conversation"`) | Agent detects mood two ways: (1) **single message** — explicit ("I'm tired") or implied ("work is killing me" → stressed); (2) **conversation flow** — after chatting for a while, read the overall vibe (tone shifts, short/curt replies, repeated topics, rising/fading energy). Agent trusts its gut and infers boldly: a small hint is enough, better to log a maybe-mood than miss a real one. Works across all channels (Telegram, voice, web). |

#### Voice mood nudge

Voice events (`voice_command`, `voice`) include a `[MANDATORY: Follow Mood skill — log mood now.]` nudge in the message sent to the agent, plus `[Current user: {name}]` when face recognition knows who is present.

#### Storage format

JSONL (one JSON object per line) — chosen over JSON array for:
- **Append**: O(1) — just write a new line (no read-parse-rewrite)
- **Crash-safe**: worst case loses 1 line (array can corrupt entire file)
- **Read last N**: `Query()` reads all lines then slices — fast enough for daily files (tens of entries)

Each row carries a `kind` field — either a raw `signal` from one source or a
`decision` synthesized by the agent from the recent signals + previous decision.
The store never fuses anything; the Mood skill is responsible for writing both
rows on every detection.

```bash
# Write — raw signal (agent calls this on every camera/voice/telegram cue)
POST /api/mood/log  {"kind":"signal","mood":"happy","source":"camera","trigger":"laughing"}

# Write — synthesized decision (agent calls this right after, after reading recent history)
POST /api/mood/log  {"kind":"decision","mood":"happy","based_on":"3 signals last 20min","reasoning":"laughing reinforces previous happy decision"}

# Read — all kinds for a day (agent uses this to re-analyze)
GET /api/openclaw/mood-history?user=gray&date=2026-04-09&last=100

# Read — latest decision only (downstream skills use this for "current mood")
GET /api/openclaw/mood-history?user=gray&kind=decision&last=1
```

Each row: `{"ts":...,"seq":1,"hour":10,"kind":"signal","mood":"happy","source":"camera","trigger":"laughing"}` for signals,
or `{"ts":...,"seq":2,"hour":10,"kind":"decision","mood":"happy","source":"agent","based_on":"...","reasoning":"..."}` for decisions.

### Cross-channel identity

The agent links face recognition names to Telegram usernames by observing timing and context (e.g., "gray" is at the desk and "@GrayDev" messages on Telegram simultaneously). Confirmed mappings are stored in `USER.md` (for the enrolled person) or the user's folder notes. The agent asks for confirmation if unsure.

## Motion Activity Analysis (while present)

When the user is already present (PRESENT state), foreground motion triggers a `motion.activity` event instead of `motion`. Same cooldown (`MOTION_EVENT_COOLDOWN_S`, 3 min) — no separate timer. The system sends the detected action name(s) (no images — action names are sufficient for the agent to infer behavior).

### How it works

`MotionPerception` buffers snapshots and action names, flushing them periodically (`MOTION_FLUSH_S`). On flush it checks `PresenceService.state`:
- **PRESENT** → sends a single `motion.activity` event. Message format:
  - `Activity detected: <labels>.` — LeLamp already categorises: physical actions collapse to the bucket name (`drink`, `break`), sedentary activities keep the raw Kinetics label (`using computer`, `writing`, `texting`, `reading book`, `reading newspaper`, `drawing`, `playing controller`). The agent logs each label verbatim — no mapping required at the agent level.
  - Emotional X3D actions (`laughing`, `crying`, `yawning`, `singing`) are **intentionally dropped** here. A dedicated `motion.emotional` event type will be added later; until then emotional detections are silently ignored. `motion.activity` stays purely physical.
  - No images attached — saves tokens. Friend recognition is **not** required.
- **Otherwise** → event is **skipped** (logged, not sent). Lumi only expects `motion.activity` — plain `motion` from X3D/pose has no handler and wastes agent tokens.

Example messages:
```
Activity detected: drink, using computer.
Activity detected: break.
Activity detected: writing, reading book.
```

### Wellbeing nudge flow (event-driven)

The agent reads the `Activity detected:` line, splits on comma, and POSTs each label verbatim as the `action` field — LeLamp already categorised, so there is no bucket mapping in the agent.

1. **Log** each label via `POST /api/wellbeing/log` with `{action, notes:"", user}` — one entry per label. Backend-side no-op; LeLamp already deduped on the outbound label set.
2. **Read history** via `GET /api/openclaw/wellbeing-history?user={name}&last=50`.
3. **Compute deltas** against the latest reset point for each kind (see Wellbeing SKILL Step 3).
4. **Decide nudge** per Wellbeing SKILL Step 4 — at most one hydration or break nudge per turn.
5. **Respond**: a single short caring sentence if there's a nudge / suggestion, otherwise `NO_REPLY`.

### Agent behavior

| Event | Emotion | Voice |
|---|---|---|
| `motion.activity` | `curious` (0.4) | YES (caring observation with context) or NO_REPLY (sedentary) |

### Per-Face Motion Activity (MotionPerFacePerception)

An optional alternative to `MotionPerception` that runs action recognition **per detected face** rather than on the full frame. Enabled via `LELAMP_MOTION_PER_FACE_ENABLED=true` (default `false`).

#### How it works

1. Subscribes to `detected_faces` updates (same as emotion perception).
2. For each face, **expands the bounding box** (1x face height up, 2x face width left/right/down) to capture upper body + hands — the region where desk activities happen.
3. Crops the expanded region from the frame.
4. Sends the crop to a **dedicated WS session** on the action recognition backend. Each `face_id` (e.g. `gray`, `stranger_5`) gets its own session with independent frame buffer.
5. Person detection is always **disabled** on these sessions — the face bbox expansion already isolates the person.

#### Per-action dedup

Each face session maintains independent per-action dedup. Within the dedup window (default 5 min), a repeated action label for the same face is suppressed — but other actions still fire.

Example:
```
t=0:00  leo → {drinking, using computer}     → SEND both
t=1:00  leo → {drinking, using computer}     → DROP both (within 5 min)
t=2:00  leo → {drinking, writing}            → SEND writing only (drinking still in window)
t=5:01  leo → {drinking}                     → SEND drinking (expired from window)
```

#### Minimum frames gate

A new face session must receive at least `MOTION_PER_FACE_MIN_FRAMES` frames (default 4) before its first event fires. This prevents noisy single-frame classifications from brief face detections.

#### Session lifecycle

- **Created** on first sight of a `face_id`.
- **Evicted** after `MOTION_PER_FACE_SESSION_TTL_S` (default 30s) without seeing that face.
- Eviction closes the WS connection to the backend and discards all buffered state.

#### Configuration

| Config | Env var | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `MOTION_PER_FACE_ENABLED` | `LELAMP_MOTION_PER_FACE_ENABLED` | `false` | Enable per-face action recognition |
| `MOTION_PER_FACE_DEDUP_WINDOW_S` | `LELAMP_MOTION_PER_FACE_DEDUP_WINDOW_S` | `300` (5 min) | Per-action dedup window per face |
| `MOTION_PER_FACE_SESSION_TTL_S` | `LELAMP_MOTION_PER_FACE_SESSION_TTL_S` | `30` | Evict WS session after this long without seeing the face |
| `MOTION_PER_FACE_MIN_FRAMES` | `LELAMP_MOTION_PER_FACE_MIN_FRAMES` | `4` | Min frames before first event fires |

#### Message format

```
Activity detected (gray): using computer, writing.
Activity detected (stranger_5): drinking.
```

Includes the `face_id` in parentheses so the agent knows which person the activity belongs to. Uses the same `motion.activity` event type as `MotionPerception`.

#### When to use

- **Multi-person scenes** — each person gets independent action classification.
- **Camera ego-motion** — the face-anchored crop is more stable than the full frame when the servo is moving.
- **Trade-off**: opens one WS connection per tracked face. For single-person desk use, standard `MotionPerception` is simpler.

## Emotion Detection — User Emotion (UC-M1) ✅

Lumi detects the **user's** emotional state via three channels:

1. **Facial expression** (primary) — `emotion.detected` event from `lelamp/service/sensing/perceptions/emotion.py`. Uses a dedicated emotion classifier running on self-hosted dlbackend via WebSocket. Detects 7 emotions: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, Neutral. Configurable confidence threshold (`EMOTION_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD`).
2. **Speech emotion** (secondary) — `speech_emotion.detected` event from `lelamp/service/voice/speech_emotion/`. Runs at the end of every speaker-identified STT session against the same WAV used for speaker recognition. Uses `emotion2vec_plus_large` on dlbackend via HTTP. See [Speech Emotion Recognition](speech-emotion.md) for the full pipeline.
3. **Body action** (tertiary) — emotional X3D actions from action recognition are **intentionally dropped** from `motion.activity` (which is purely physical: sedentary/drink/break). A dedicated `motion.emotional` event type is planned for these.

> **Not to be confused with Emotion Expression** (`emotion/SKILL.md`) — which controls Lumi's own emotional output (servo + LED + eyes). Emotion Detection is about sensing what the *user* feels; Emotion Expression is how *Lumi* shows its feelings.

### `emotion.detected` event

Fired by LeLamp when the dlbackend emotion classifier detects a facial expression above the confidence threshold. Message format:

```
Emotion detected: <Label>. (weak camera cue; confidence=<0.00-1.00>; bucket=<positive|negative|other>; treat as uncertain, <bucket-tuned hedge>.)
```

Concrete examples:

```
Emotion detected: Fear. (weak camera cue; confidence=0.62; bucket=negative; treat as uncertain, do not assume the user is distressed.)
Emotion detected: Happy. (weak camera cue; confidence=0.78; bucket=positive; treat as uncertain, do not over-celebrate.)
```

The raw `Emotion detected: <Label>.` prefix is preserved so `user-emotion-detection/SKILL.md`'s parser and the Fear→stressed / Sad→sad mood mapping keep working unchanged. The trailing parenthetical exists to stop the LLM from over-committing on noisy FER reads (the bug it fixed: Fear → "Oh hello there again" greeting). Hedge clauses by bucket: `negative` → "do not assume the user is distressed"; `positive` → "do not over-celebrate"; `other` → "do not over-react".

**Polarity-bucket dedup** (`EMOTION_BUCKETS` in `lelamp/service/sensing/perceptions/processors/emotion.py`) collapses fine-grained labels into `positive` / `negative` / `other` and dedups by `(current_user, bucket)` over a 5-min window. Within-bucket noise (Fear↔Sad↔Anger) becomes one event per window; cross-bucket flips (Fear→Happy) still fire as a genuine mood change. Confidence in the message is averaged over instances of the dominant label only — other labels' scores don't dilute it.

The sensing handler (`handler.go`) routes `emotion.detected` events to the agent. When the agent is busy, these events are queued and replayed when idle.

### Agent behavior

The `user-emotion-detection/SKILL.md` handles `emotion.detected` events:

1. Maps facial emotion → mood signal (e.g. Happy → happy, Sad → sad, Angry → frustrated, Fear → stressed) and logs a `signal` row via `POST /api/mood/log`
2. Picks one response route from a 3-row table (first match wins):
   - **#1 `audio_playing == true`** → LED-only ack + `NO_REPLY` (don't talk over music)
   - **#2 `suggestion_worthy == true` AND decision fresh AND `last_suggestion_age_min ∉ [0, 7)`** → **music** — gentle one-liner with genre pick via `music-suggestion/SKILL.md`
   - **#3 anything else** → **checkin** — a short human reaction. See `user-emotion-detection/reference/checkin.md` for per-emotion examples (templates are keyed by raw FER label — Sad/Fear/Angry/Disgust/Happy/Surprise — with three style options: Ask, Comfort, Invite). Examples are inspiration only; agent improvises per turn.
3. **Cooldown only gates music, never checkin.** When the 7-min cooldown is active, row #2 fails its third clause and the event falls through to checkin (row #3). The agent still asks "what's up?" — it just doesn't suggest music two times in a row. `NO_REPLY` only fires on row #1 (active audio playback).
4. **Never greet on an emotion event.** `emotion.detected` is not a presence/arrival event — `sensing/SKILL.md` forbids openers like `hello`, `welcome back`, anything containing `again`. Greetings belong only to `presence.enter`.

Both routes share one cooldown: music logs via `POST /api/music-suggestion/log` with `trigger:"<genre>:<mood>"` (mood bucket); checkin logs the same endpoint with `trigger:"checkin:<emotion>"` (raw FER label). `last_suggestion_age_min` reflects either channel, so a fresh music suggestion silences the music branch for 7 min but doesn't silence checkin. Checkin phrasing is keyed by raw emotion (not mood) so each FER label has its own ask/comfort/invite style options — see `reference/checkin.md`. Always prefix `[HW:/emotion:{"emotion":"caring","intensity":0.5}]` on checkin output.

### Mood pipeline

- **Mood history** (agent logs): On every signal the Mood skill writes a raw `signal` row, then reads recent history and writes a synthesized `decision` row (e.g. `{"kind":"decision","mood":"happy","based_on":"...","reasoning":"..."}`).
- Mood decisions trigger downstream skills: `music-suggestion` (proactive music), `wellbeing` (break/hydration nudges).

See `user-emotion-detection/SKILL.md` for the agent's full response rules.

### `speech_emotion.detected` event

Fired by LeLamp at the end of every speaker-identified STT session, after the same WAV bytes used for speaker `/embed` are forwarded to `dlbackend /api/dl/ser/recognize` (emotion2vec_plus_large). Buffering, per-user aggregation, polarity-bucket dedup, and the Lumi POST are all handled inside `lelamp/service/voice/speech_emotion/SpeechEmotionService` — `voice_service.py` only calls `submit(user, wav, duration)`. Message format mirrors the facial pipeline:

```
Speech emotion detected: <Label>. (weak voice cue; confidence=<0.00-1.00>; bucket=<positive|negative|other>; treat as uncertain, <bucket-tuned hedge>.)
```

Concrete examples:

```
Speech emotion detected: Sad. (weak voice cue; confidence=0.72; bucket=negative; treat as uncertain, do not assume the user is distressed.)
Speech emotion detected: Happy. (weak voice cue; confidence=0.84; bucket=positive; treat as uncertain, do not over-celebrate.)
```

Labels (from emotion2vec_plus_large): `angry`, `disgusted`, `fearful`, `happy`, `neutral`, `other`, `sad`, `surprised`, `<unk>`. Neutral / other / `<unk>` are dropped before bucketing — same rule as facial Neutral.

**Anti-spam guards** (mirror the facial pipeline 1-to-1):

1. Short audio (`duration_s < SPEECH_EMOTION_MIN_AUDIO_S`) dropped at `submit()`.
2. Unknown speaker (`match=false` or `name=="unknown"`) dropped — no subject to attribute emotion to.
3. Low-confidence inferences (`< SPEECH_EMOTION_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD`) dropped by the worker.
4. Neutral labels dropped at flush time.
5. `(user, bucket)` TTL dedup over `SPEECH_EMOTION_DEDUP_WINDOW_S` (default 5 min). Each bucket keeps an independent timer — sending a positive event does not reset the negative window.

The event payload carries `current_user` explicitly so the Lumi sensing handler doesn't need to look it up.

### Agent behavior (shared with face emotion)

`speech_emotion.detected` routes through the **same** skill as `emotion.detected` — `user-emotion-detection/SKILL.md`. The sensing handler tags the incoming message with `[speech_emotion]` (vs `[emotion]` for face), pre-fetches the same `[emotion_context: ...]` block, and forwards to the agent. The skill:

1. Parses the prefix to decide `source` on the mood signal log (`"voice"` for `[speech_emotion]`, `"camera"` for `[emotion]`).
2. Maps the label via the shared table: `Happy → happy`, `Sad → sad`, `Angry → frustrated`, `Fear`/`Fearful → stressed`, `Surprise`/`Surprised → excited`, `Disgust`/`Disgusted → frustrated`, `Neutral → normal`. Voice variants (`Fearful`, `Surprised`, `Disgusted`) bucket identically to their face counterparts.
3. Runs the same `music / checkin / action / silent` router on the same `[emotion_context: ...]` fields (`audio_playing`, `suggestion_worthy`, `last_suggestion_age_min`, `is_decision_stale`).
4. Shares one music-suggestion cooldown across both modalities — voice cannot bypass a cooldown that a recent camera signal set, and vice versa.

The hedge `(weak voice cue; ...)` in the message is the model's signal to prefer Comfort/Invite checkin phrasing over Ask on voice-only negative reads, since short-utterance emotion2vec is noisier than face FER. See `user-emotion-detection/SKILL.md` for the full rules.

See [Speech Emotion Recognition](speech-emotion.md) for the full architecture, threading model, configuration table, and failure modes.

## Snapshot Storage (two-tier)

Sensing events that include a camera frame (`motion`, `presence.enter`, `presence.leave`, `motion.activity`, `emotion.detected`, `music.mood`) save snapshots in two locations.

| Tier | Path | Rotation | Survives reboot |
|------|------|----------|-----------------|
| **Tmp buffer** | `/tmp/lumi-sensing-snapshots/sensing_<prefix>/` | Count-based (max 50 files) | No |
| **Persistent** | `/var/lib/lelamp/snapshots/sensing_<prefix>/` | TTL (72h) + size (50 MB max) | Yes |

Each event kind writes to its own subdir (`sensing_<prefix>`, e.g. `sensing_presence/`, `sensing_motion_activity/`, `sensing_emotion/`). Filenames are `<ms>.jpg`. Every snapshot is saved to tmp first, then copied to the persistent dir. The persistent path is included in the event message (`[snapshot: /var/lib/lelamp/snapshots/sensing_<prefix>/<ms>.jpg]`) so the agent can reference it later — even after a device reboot. Monitor serves them via `GET /api/sensing/snapshot/<category>/<name>`.

Configuration constants are in `lelamp/config.py`:
- `SNAPSHOT_TMP_MAX_COUNT` — max files in tmp (default 50)
- `SNAPSHOT_PERSIST_TTL_S` — persistent file TTL in seconds (default 72h)
- `SNAPSHOT_PERSIST_MAX_BYTES` — max total size of persistent dir (default 50 MB)

---

## General Rules (all event types)

- **Pending event replay**: When the agent is busy, `presence.enter`, `presence.leave`, and `voice` events are queued and replayed when the agent becomes idle. The replay path (`drainPendingEvents` in `service.go`) applies the same nudge messages as the live handler (cron setup for presence.enter, cleanup for presence.leave, etc.).
- **Passive sensing events** (`[sensing:*]`) are dropped if the agent is already busy with another turn (except presence and voice events which are queued).
- **Voice events** always pass through — the user is explicitly speaking. Voice messages include a mood scan nudge (`[MANDATORY: Follow Mood skill — log mood now.]`) so the agent remembers to detect mood from the conversation flow.
- The `[sensing:type]` prefix in the message is how the agent knows it's an ambient event, not a user message.
- **Pre-turn `thinking` emotion**: The `emotion-acknowledge` hook fires `POST /emotion {thinking, 0.7}` server-side at `message:preprocessed` for every non-sensing message — the agent does not need to call it. Sensing events are skipped by the hook because each type has its own defined first emotion.
- **Image pruning echo**: OpenClaw strips old image payloads from conversation history to save tokens. Smaller models (Haiku) may echo the pruning markers as `[image description removed]` in their response text. `SOUL.md` instructs the agent to never echo these markers.
