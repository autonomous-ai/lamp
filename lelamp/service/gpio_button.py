"""GPIO button handler for pin 17.

Supports four actions on a single button:
- Single click: stop speaker / unmute mic
- Triple click: reboot OS
- Hold + release (5–10s):  shutdown OS
- Hold + release (10s+):   factory-reset (wipe state, reboot to AP setup)

Destructive actions commit ON RELEASE, not on a timer firing while held,
so the user can cancel mid-hold by releasing before crossing a threshold
(or keep holding past 10s to escalate from shutdown → factory-reset).

Double-click and 4+ rapid clicks are intentional no-ops — destructive
actions (reboot/shutdown/factory-reset) need a deliberate gesture so a
user panic-clicking the button to interrupt TTS doesn't accidentally
reboot.

The actual action logic lives in `button_actions.py` so other input
devices (touchpad, remote) can reuse the same gestures.
